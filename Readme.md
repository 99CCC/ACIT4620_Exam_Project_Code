## ACIT4620 Exam Project
The project extracts public transport data from open sources, and model them as a complex network.
The aim for the project is to model three types of public transport (Trains, Metro and Buss) as a layered complex network, where stations/stops are presented as Nodes and railways/roads are presented as edges.
